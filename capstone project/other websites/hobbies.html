    <p><font size="+1">Putting my favorite hobby last, weightlifting! I'm a huge person on just getting bigger and always improving my past lifts. Also doing weightlifting gives me a better mental state also and also gives me the dedication as to go to the gym and do a workout just as i wake up everyday to do a small piece of web development code</font></p>
